Realized after completing exam, that the way I tested the Professor Class was incorrect as it did not properly test the getters and setters. This was done after the exam time and is not commited.  
using YourProfessor;

{
        // Creating a Professor object
        Professor professor = new Professor("L123456", "John", "Doe", "Computer Science");

        // Displaying the Professor details
        Console.WriteLine(professor.ToString());

        // Testing setters and getters
        professor.LNumber = "L654321";
        professor.Department = "Mathematics";

        // Displaying the updated Professor details
        Console.WriteLine(professor.ToString());

        // Testing getters individually
        Console.WriteLine($"LNumber: {professor.LNumber}");
        Console.WriteLine($"First Name: {professor.FirstName}");
        Console.WriteLine($"Last Name: {professor.LastName}");
        Console.WriteLine($"Department: {professor.Department}");
    }
